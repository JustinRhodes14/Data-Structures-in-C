# Data-Structures-in-C

This was the first project I had to do in my Computer Architecture class. It allowed for the class to learn the C programming language, while refreshing on our knowledge of Data Structures. All of the programs relate to various forms of data structures, such as linked lists, binary trees, hash tables, and matrices.
